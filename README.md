# WORK IN PROGRESS !!! (29/08/24)
## Introduction
+ **A guide in .pdf format (English language, 64 pages for version 1.1) is included, it is a must-read, everything is explained in detail !** <br />
+ **Be careful! The resin severely attacks the printed plastic, as explained in the guide, you will need to apply a protective varnish on the tank as well as on the printing plate** <br />
+ Here you will find all the files and instructions on my homemade MSLA Cyclop v1.3 resin printer (and its Helios curing station) ! <br />
The CAD files (.step format) are available, the appropriate GRBl firmware as well as the NanoDLP version that I used. <br />
